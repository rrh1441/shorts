# Operational Efficiency Breakthrough

## Executive Summary

Organizations struggle with manual processes that create inefficiency and wasted resources. Teams chase alerts while expensive issues slip through the cracks. Last year, major incidents took weeks and cost six figures to resolve.

## The Solution

The breakthrough is simple: score impact first, then spend time. By quantifying risk in dollars, routing by impact, and proving savings, teams can transform their operations.

## Case Study: MidCo

MidCo implemented impact-based routing and cut resolve time by 30% in just one quarter. Their systematic approach to prioritization eliminated firefighting and delivered measurable results.

## Next Steps

Start with the two-minute assessment to see where your time pays off. Transform reactive firefighting into proactive impact management.
